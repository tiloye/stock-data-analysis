# Stock Comparison Dashboard
In these project, I built a stocks comparison dashboard to easily compare some statiscal metrics of various stocks in SP500 index. The stock list stocks gotten from [wikipedia]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies"), and each stock's historical data is downloaded from Yahoo Finance.

The dashboard consists of 4 main components:
1. A dropdown menu to search or select from a list of stock symbols
2. A plotly graph to show different plots of the historical data and rolling statistics
3. A table to show a summary of the computed metrics for selected stocks
